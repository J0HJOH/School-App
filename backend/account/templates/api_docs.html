                                Make a Post request using the endpoint:
                                <div class="request">
                                    <p class="authorized-request create-endpoint">

                                </div>
                                Ensure you read the <a href="{% url 'api:create-keys' %}">On how to make an Authorized request</a> with
                                your API keys before procceding with your post request. 

                                <p>The underlisted parameters are needed when creating a user:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The User's Name</li>
                                    <li>The User's Email Address</li>
                                    <li>The 'User's Department</li>
                                    <li>The 'User's Password</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    The User's Name and Password is made to be unique accross the board. That means that, not more than one account can be created with the same name or email.
                                    This is to ensure that, no user can have more one account.
                                    If for instance a user input the same name or email or both name and email that has been created and saved before in 
                                    the database, a status code of 400 is retured showing a bad request and returing
                                    a response showing the following:

                                    <div class="request">
                                        <p class="authorized-request bad-data">

                                                ] 
                                            }}

                                        More importantly, GoDocs added a layer of security to the user's Password
                                        ensuring that the User inputed a strong password. Therefore, if a request
                                        is been made with a poor password, a status code of 400 will be shown.
                                        This implies that, a poor request has been made and in return it shows 
                                        an error message.

                                        
                                    </p>

                                    In a similar way to how we <a href="#create-account">created users</a> using the api endpoint, we can also

                                    Similar to how we <a href="#create-account">created users</a>
                                    you can also update a user credentials, simply by making a 'PUT' request to
                                    the endpoint:    
                                </p>

                                Ensure you replace '{{request.user.id}}' with the user's id and add the field and also the 
                                value of the field that you want to update to the body similar to how 
                                it was done when we <a href="#create-account">created users</a> but this time 
                                selectively pick the field that you want to update. For instance; if 
                                you only want to update the name of the user, only add name as the 
                                key to the body and let the name of the user be the value. In a similar way, you can update several 
                                fieldset at the same time by inputing all the fieldset of the user that you want to update and the value 
                                to the body.

                                   <strong>Note:</strong> More importantly, the password fieldset can not be updated using this route. 
                                    It can only be updated if the user request for a password reset incases were the user forgets their password. A verfication email and 
                                    a link will be sent to the user via email were the user will be able to change his/her password.
